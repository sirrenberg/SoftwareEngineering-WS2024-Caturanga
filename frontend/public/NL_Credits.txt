Netlight has been a valuable companion and partner by our side since the beginning of the Caturanga project. From highly competent advice on more holistic aspects such as idea generation, planning, implementation, and execution, to specific support on the technical level, such as deploying the final version, Netlight has enabled a focused and efficient project execution.
Furthermore, Netlight was generous enough to cover the costs incurred during the development and maintenance of the Caturanga project.
