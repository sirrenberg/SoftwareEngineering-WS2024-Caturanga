export const ACLED_CREDITS : string = `
The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) has supported Caturanga with the collection, processing and mapping of conflict data, especially concerning the locations of camps, towns and cities, conflict related data as well as population data.

Since high quality and accurate data is the basis for performant and valuable simulations, the ACLED played an outstanding role of utmost importance for the successful realization of the Caturanga project.

export const FLEE_CREDITS : string = `
As an agent-based modeling toolkit specifically designed for simulating the movement of individual refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) across geographical locations, FLEE constitutes the core element of the simulation execution in Caturanga.
In collaboration with Dr. Derek Groen of Brunel University London, we have substantiated the appropriateness of the FLEE toolkit for our project's objective of refugee flow simulation based on agent-based modeling. He and his team further supported us during the ideation and implementation phase of the project.

export const NETLIGHT_CREDITS : string = `
Netlight has been a valuable companion and partner by our side since the beginning of the Caturanga project. From highly competent advice on more holistic aspects such as idea generation, planning, implementation, and execution, to specific support on the technical level, such as deploying the final version, Netlight has enabled a focused and efficient project execution.
Furthermore, Netlight was generous enough to cover the costs incurred during the development and maintenance of the Caturanga project.
